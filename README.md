# Memory Game Project
It is one of my Udacity Projects with JS. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Rules and Regulations:
The game starts with clicking on acard. The chosen card flips and the timer starts. After fliping the second card, if the picture on the second card matches the picture on the first card this will be a successful move and the cards will be marked as successfully fliped! otherwise both cards will flip again to the original position and the user should try his/her chance with a new choice. The game will be finished when all cards are marked as successful flips !

The game offers a star rating also. It sarts with 3 stars. As soon as the player exceeds 15 moves, one star will be reduced. the second star will be reduced when 23 moves are already done. The player will recieve no stars if he can not end the game with less than 33 moves.

At the end of the game information about star rating, number of moves done, time passed and options like replay will be shown.
